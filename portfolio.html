      <h3>CTO, Openlectures
        <span class="meta__year">2012-2014</span>
      </h3>
      <p>Openlectures is a non-profit organization that strives to provide free, quality education by students, for students. I joined the tech team of 2 in early 2011, with the suggestion of a complete rewrite of their website in Ruby on Rails (back then RoR was hot, and the site still ran on a hacked-up Wordpress). Together, we completed the rewrite as well as a redesign in a few months. I took over as CTO soon after in 2012. Over the two year period, we tried lots of funky stuff, such as a Google spreadsheet to Postgresql synchronization platform. This allowed instructors to input new lecture data quickly.</p>

      <h3>Intern, Tinkertanker
        <span class="meta__year">2015-2016</span>
      </h3>
      <p>I joined Tinkertanker in December 2015, after a 2 year stint in the army. I was tasked to build several applications, while given the freedom of choice of language and framework. I chose Clojure to build <a href="#aagenda">aagenda</a>, a <a href="http://edubot.tk.sg/">Slack inviter</a> (with extra spice!), and a clone of Pidgeonhole for a client of theirs, and learnt much in the process.</p>
      <p>Part of the job involved teaching kids of varying ages different levels of programming, from Scratch to basic Node.js. Through this I learnt how to convey technical knowledge to beginners in programming effectively.</p>

      <h3>Member, Fisherman
        <span class="meta__year">2016-present</span>
      </h3>
      <p>I was one of the early adopters of Fisherman. Bucaran had approached me to try out this cool new shell snippet manager, and I loved cool and new stuff, so one could say he hit my soft spot. Since, I've produced <a href="http://fisherman.sh/?q=jethrokuan">several quality plugins</a> that hundreds of people depend on.</p>
      <p>This was my first real attempt at open-source work, and it has taught me how to make my code less fragile and more accessible to others.</p>
