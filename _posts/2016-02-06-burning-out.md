title: "Burning Out"
---
It's been more than a month into work, and the reduction in my productivity levels has become to great for me to ignore.

I reach home mentally exhausted from a full day of work, yet I turn my computer on, and continue hammering away at my keyboard for a few hours more, until it's almost bedtime. I seek help from people who are better than me on the clojurian Slack channel, and work hard at fixing the bugs I introduced in my program during the day. Then I take a few hours every day to work on a part-time project I very often regret taking on.

Weekends are no better. I spend most of the morning resting up from the mental exhausion accrued during the weekdays. Out of habit, I wake up at about 9am everyday. My head still feels heavy, so I lie awake on bed, my mind blank, vaguely appreciative that the it's the weekend. I begin studying soon after lunch: Communicating Sequential Processes, competitive programming are amongst the few things I'm brushing up on over my weekends. I do this because I need the knowledge to deal with the intricacies of my work during the weekdays. After I feel like I've stopped absorbing anything, I continue work on the part-time project.

Contrary to my current behaviour, there are many things I want to make time for, including exercising, and learning the guitar.

I have to remind myself that I should be working 9-5 on my day job, no more, no less. Another 2 hours on the part-time project every weekday. No more, no less.

I also have to remind myself that I don't have to spend my weekends just so I can make more progress during my 9-5 job.

Irregardless of how much I feel like I need to study, I'll be spending my nights and weekends exercising, playing the guitar, and resting up for the next day.

I will never let work take over my life.
