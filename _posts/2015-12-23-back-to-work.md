title: Back To Work
---

On Monday, December 14 2015, I joined tinkertanker as an intern. I had bigger plans for myself then. Due to several unspoken circumstances I put aside my ambitions, and started as a humble codemonkey in this startup with a staff of no more than 10.

I have attained multiple firsts in just 8 days.

This was my first paid job. I used to do non-profit work as CTO of [openlectures](http://openlectures.org/), which I have learnt has shutdown not-too-recently. During my stint there I maintained a Ruby-on-Rails stack, one which has code of quality similar to Tekong cookhouse food. I also did some video editing for [The Hidden Good](http://thehiddengood.com/ ) in its preliminary days, nothing too fancy.

Nothing like this. As a first task, I  wrote in Smalltalk, an arcane language I've never learnt before. I had to interface the software I wrote with Arduinos, which firmware was written in C, yet another field and language I have little past experience in. But when money comes into the picture, you know you have got to deliver. Reading countless number of pages of documentation and random blog posts was something I would never do otherwise.

I also built and deployed my first Clojure app. I've been a fan of the language for a while, but have never ventured beyond Clojure Koans or 4Clojure. Having an actual problem to work on was an issue I had before I joined tinkertanker, and when tasked to build a web app I knew I had to choose Clojure. While still an amateur at the language, I managed to remain highly productive, learning multiple libraries simultaneously (`compojure`, `yesql`, `clj-http`, `aleph` etc.), and deploy it on AWS. 

I can't understate how positive my experience thus far at tinkertanker has been, and am insanely thankful I took up this internship.
