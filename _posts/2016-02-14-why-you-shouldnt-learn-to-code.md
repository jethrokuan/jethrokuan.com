title: "Why You Shouldn't Learn to Code"
---

This is both a manifestation of my frustration, and a sincere plea to those about to take their first step. The "everyone should learn how to code" movement has been taken too far. 

Programming does not belong amongst reading, writing and arithmetics as essential skills. Learning to think like a progammer could be, but not progamming.

Don't get me wrong, I love programming. It has given me the ability to express certain ideas clearly, ideas so abstract it would be difficult or even impossible to do the same in spoken languages. This is not an ability you require. It would benefit you more to work on expressing yourself in the spoken languages, than to wrestle with a medium that takes years to master, and yet remain unapplicable.

"What's a good language to begin with?"

"What do I have to learn to build a website?"

Wrong questions.

The first question you should ask yourself is: "Why do you want to learn programming?" Let's address the possible answers.

## "I think it's a good skill to learn"
Why would you think so? In what way would learning how to program make your life better?

More importantly, what exactly does said "skill" refer to? Are you clear on the amount of effort required to learn said skill?

## "I like to build things"
Websites like [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) and [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) claim to teach you how to code. In a couple of days, you'll be able to make a website, and maybe even add some interactivity. Give yourself a pat on the back. You've built your first website.

Riding the momentum you gained from the sense of achievement, you dig in further. You learn the latest CSS frameworks to make your website prettier. You learn Javascript and jQuery to make things fly across the screen. Before you know it, months have gone by.

You take some time to reflect on what you've learnt. You can only think of one thing: how to make a decent website. Everything else is beyond your comfort zone and level of understanding. This skill is 90% orthogonal to whatever you'll end up doing in the future.

**Programming is not about being able to code. It's about being able to create solutions to existing problems.** Nothing about making a website teaches you that. This methodology of introducing progamming is fundamentally incorrect.

**Programming is hard**. It's not just hard, it's boring. Websites like Codecademy lower the bar by showing the masses that it is easy to produce tangible products. Just because everyone can learn to code, doesn't mean everyone should.

Heed my advice: **don't learn how to code. Learn how to solve problems**.

## What rogramming really is

Learning to program entails learning how to break down a problem, understanding the problem domain, thinking in the appropriate abstractions, and producing a concise solution. A programming language is just a tool to express the solution in a mathematical, machine-readable language. Problem-solving is the essential skill. It enhances critical thinking.

## So what now?

[How To Solve It] is a great book on problem solving. It presents four principles of problem solving, and while presented in a mathematical context, remains highly applicable in other fields.

If you have a genuine interest in programming, [SICP] is the greatest introductory course on programming by a long shot. It may seem a little dry, but the simplicity of the ideas presented will consistently blow your mind. 

If looking merely to broaden your perspective on computational and mathematical theories, I highly recommend [The Eternal Golden Braid], which serves this purpose well through the eclectic mix of Greek mythology, mathematics and music.
